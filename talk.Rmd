## Multilayer Perceptron

## Optimizer

## Convolution

## Pooling

## Lets Get Deep

## Automated Feature Generation

## Getting More Complex

RNN, LSTM, GAN

# Challenges in Deep Learning

## Structure Search

$\rightarrow$ Transfer learning.

## Expensive Training

$\rightarrow$ Use server or GPUs.

## Low-Level Implementations

cudnn, CUDA, ...

# Where to Start in the DL Jungle

## Getting Started with Keras - Installation

## Getting Started with Keras - Overview

-   Instead of introducing theory fist, we want to get into the topic by applying it.

-   We use examples from the book \href{https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python}{\alert{Deep Learning with Python}} which are prepared as \href{https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks}{\alert{notebooks}}.

-   **But**: When using something new, e.g. a convolution layer or optimizer, try to understand what it does and why it might be beneficial!

## NLP

Very very short intro how text mining connects to deep learning (gensim, word vectors, ...)

## Reinforcement Learning

This is what comes closest to AI as we are thinking of it. Just show examples
